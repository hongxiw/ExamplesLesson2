## Lesson 2 Practice
This repo is an improved version of a small challenge I presented. The objective was to write a Car class that supports a few basic actions with some instance variables. This version implements some features thought of but not included in the [original](https://github.com/coderwang23/Lesson-2).
## Original Lesson
